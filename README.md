## Article 2
In this article, I will share with you the structure of testing and illustrate the concepts based an example Spring Boot application.

The testing approach is to firstly verify each component, then check a whole system and finally test everything together with external services infrastructure components.
1. **Unit Test** — Verify behavior of each individual component.
2. **Integration Test** — Check system feature as a whole without plugging to external components.
3. **End-to-end Test** — Test the system together with all infrastructure components and external services.
